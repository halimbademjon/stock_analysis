# Various stock analysis/data retrieval code snippets

Experimenting with simple stock market analysis and data retrieval using Python. Contains examples on various functions like:

* Algorithmic data on a particular stock
* List of tickers on different exchanges
* Current market sentiment
* Sentiment analysis on a particular stock
* Issuing a buy order
* etc...

Of all the service available "out there", I found these to be the easiest to use. Minimum need for installing dependencies/requirements, or writing code to scrape websites etc...
